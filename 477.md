# EE477 Final Project: Improve the branch predictor and/or BTB performance

## Project Idea
Our project is under the umbrealla title "Improve the branch predictor and/or BTB performance". The optimization is focused on the Branch Prediction unit. We’re planning to update the branch prediction mechanism from a simple bimodal prediction to a global history-based g-select mechanism. The motivitation behind the optimisation is that the modified g-select mechanism can utilize the history of memory access pattern globally, and make better prediction for workloads which are not sequential in nature and have a problem size greater than ‘2 instructions’ which is the limit for the cureent bimodal predictor.
